# Feedback & Grievance System

This project is a feedback and grievance system for a restaurant named Aromatic Bar. The system includes a feedback form and a submission data table to view all feedback entries. The feedback form collects the customer's name, email, phone, and ratings for various aspects of the dining experience.

The submissions can be viewed in a table with a search feature.
